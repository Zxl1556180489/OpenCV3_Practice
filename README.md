## Practice to Use OpenCV3.0

Since I'm new to OpenCV, I followed the [tutorials](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html)
 to practice. Most of the codes are directly copied from the tutorials, but I found that there are bugs in the tutorials, 
 maybe because it's a *beta* version doc. I tried to fix those bugs so I think the codes are runnable, mostly.  
 
 
 I put the codes in folder `test`, and all the images and video are in folder `img`.
